			<p>
				Welcome to my CS 313 homepage! Please enjoy your stay and view my progress as I learn the world of web engineering from the server's point of
				view. My name is Grant Merrill. I am a junior, studying at Brigham Young University-Idaho and will be graduating (if all goes well) at the end
				of 2016. I love to play piano and violin. I am also a big gamer. I love making "Let's Play" videos and speedrunning video games. Combining
				video games and music is one of my favorite things to do. I am unsure what I will be wanting to do after I graduate but hopefully something
				awesome! Thanks for reading!
